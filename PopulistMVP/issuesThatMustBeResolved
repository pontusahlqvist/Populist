Issues: 
-parse creates duplicate events even when not queried simultaneously - Reason: max number of events returned is 100. Then with the local and global, this becomes 200. Thus, since there are a lot of nearby events, it will sometimes not return the one that’s next to you. Must filter on last update I guess…
-if 0.9 event is merged into another 0.9 event, neither show up in the exploreVC. Must update importance after merge.
-titlephotos are sometimes empty for events without title image
